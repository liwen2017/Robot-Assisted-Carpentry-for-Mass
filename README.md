# Robot-Assisted-Carpentry-for-Mass
As we discussed, we need to design two modified drill presses. We need to be able to place the lumber on a surface that defines the position and orientation of the lumber, but allows the lumber to slide. This is what we do on the chopsaw, the planes of the chopsaw define the lumber position and orientation, but allow the lumber to slide past the cutting location.  We need two designs because one will approach the wood from above, and the other will approach from the sides. We need the accuracy of the drill to be within 1mm in positioning of location and depth.  Unlike the chopsaw, we need to be able to move one of the reference planes in order to place the drill location.  To design the drill, please use solidworks 2016 or onshape so we are all on the same software.   The drills must be able to communicate with our software using ROS, written in python. We usually do this by using a serial communication on the Arduino to a python program on the computer.
